The landscape of web development has evolved significantly. Modern web apps need to be fast, accessible, and provide excellent user experiences. Let's explore the key components of building a modern web application.

## The Modern Tech Stack

A typical modern web application stack includes:

- **Frontend Framework**: React, Vue, or Svelte
- **Meta-framework**: Next.js, Nuxt, or SvelteKit
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or CSS-in-JS
- **State Management**: Zustand, Jotai, or React Query
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Supabase
- **Authentication**: Auth.js, Clerk, or Lucia

## Performance Matters

Performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here are some best practices:

### Code Splitting

Split your JavaScript bundles to load only what's needed:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
});
```

### Image Optimization

Always optimize your images for the web:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero image"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority
/>
```

## Accessibility First

Building accessible applications is not optional. Consider:

1. Semantic HTML elements
2. Proper heading hierarchy
3. Keyboard navigation
4. Screen reader support
5. Color contrast ratios

## Deployment and DevOps

Modern deployment is streamlined with platforms like:

- **Vercel** - Perfect for Next.js
- **Netlify** - Great for static sites
- **Railway** - Excellent for full-stack apps
- **Fly.io** - Edge computing made easy

## Conclusion

Building modern web applications requires attention to performance, accessibility, and user experience. By following best practices and using the right tools, you can create applications that users love.
