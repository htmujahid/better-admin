Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build fast, scalable web applications with ease. In this guide, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a Next.js project.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several features out of the box:

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** for improved SEO and performance
- **Static site generation (SSG)** for blazing-fast pages
- **API routes** for building backend functionality
- **File-based routing** for intuitive navigation
- **Built-in CSS and Sass support**

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new project with all the necessary dependencies.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── public/
├── package.json
└── next.config.ts
```

> The `app` directory is where all your routes and components live. Each folder represents a route segment.

## Creating Your First Page

In Next.js 13+, you create pages by adding a `page.tsx` file inside a folder:

```tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of Next.js, you can:

1. Explore the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
2. Learn about data fetching patterns
3. Implement authentication
4. Deploy your app to Vercel

Happy coding!
